# Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v7.0.0 or later)

# Getting Started 

1. Clone or download the repository containing the project

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Install project dependencies by running the following command:

  ```
  npm start
  ```
 4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server with the following command:

  ``` 
  npm run dev
  ```
  This will start the Vite development server and provide you with a local development URL (usually http://localhost:3000).
